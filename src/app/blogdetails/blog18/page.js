                Research proposals must explicitly articulate the
                candidates&#39; area of interest and the rationale behind their
                intention to conduct research in that specific topic. In the
                absence of proper articulation and strategic planning of the
                proposal&#39;s framework, there is a possibility that the
                Selection Committee may get an erroneous impression, so

                background, the rationale for investigating the chosen research
                idea or the importance of the specific research problem, the
                research objectives and primary research questions, and the
                literature review, among other elements. Subsequently, the
                technique and research design are presented, accompanied by a
                projected timeline outlining the duration of the research and
                the anticipated outcome of the study, ensuring a comprehensive
                and reliable approach.
