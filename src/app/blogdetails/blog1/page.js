                Every individual have the ability to conduct research, however,
                it is our educational system that is responsible for our latent
                research aptitude. Our degree is determined by our grades and
                evaluations. We solely focus on studying the content provided in
                the book, without making any effort to comprehend or apply it.
                Furthermore, our focus is just on the fundamental aspects of any
                subject, whilst in the realm of research, we have achieved the
                pinnacle in every field. Consider the example of a network. In
                books, we may have learned the concept and fundamentals of a
                network. In the realm of academic inquiry, researchers have
                initiated investigations into artificial networks, neural
                networks, and related areas.
