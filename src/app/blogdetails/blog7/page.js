                Topics in Deep Learning

                Deep Learning is one of the fastest growing fields in the
                current times as it is one of the types of Machine Learning
                which comes under the wider field of Artificial Intelligence.
                Deep Learning imitates human behaviour and knowledge and it can
                be further subdivided into supervised, semi-supervised and
                unsupervised. Deep Learning has become a crucial part of data
                science including the statistics and predictive modelling and is
                still a highly researched area in machine learning. A lot of
                candidates come up with the idea of preparing a research paper
                or developing their PhD thesis on deep learning but cannot
                figure out the method and plan to do a research that does not
                include unnecessary information. The newness of a subject can
                also make it hard for choosing the right research method with
                lesser available resources. However, Research Developers has
                editors and writers who are well aware of the appropriate topics
                that can fit your research and are of interest.
